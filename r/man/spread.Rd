\title{Estimation of Bid-Ask Spreads from Open, High, Low, and Close Prices}
\usage{
spread(x, width = nrow(x), method = "EDGE", sign = FALSE, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[xts]{xts}} object with columns named \code{Open}, \code{High}, \code{Low}, \code{Close}.}

\item{width}{integer width of the rolling window to use, or vector of endpoints defining the intervals to use. By default, the whole time series is used to compute a single spread estimate.}

\item{method}{the estimator(s) to use. See details.}

\item{sign}{whether to return signed estimates.}

\item{na.rm}{whether to ignore missing values.}
}
\value{
Time series of spread estimates. A value of 0.01 corresponds to a spread of 1\%.
}
\description{
This function implements several methods to estimate bid-ask spreads
from open, high, low, and close prices.
}
\details{
The method \code{EDGE} implements the Efficient Discrete Generalized Estimator described in Ardia, Guidotti, & Kroencke (2024).

The methods \code{OHL}, \code{OHLC}, \code{CHL}, \code{CHLO} implement the generalized estimators described in Ardia, Guidotti, & Kroencke (2024).
They can be combined by concatenating their identifiers, e.g., \code{OHLC.CHLO} uses an average of the \code{OHLC} and \code{CHLO} estimators.

The method \code{AR} implements the estimator described in Abdi & Ranaldo (2017). \code{AR2} implements their 2-period version.

The method \code{CS} implements the estimator described in Corwin & Schultz (2012). \code{CS2} implements their 2-period version. Both versions are adjusted for overnight (close-to-open) returns as described in the paper.

The method \code{ROLL} implements the estimator described in Roll (1984).

\examples{
# simulate open, high, low, and close prices with spread 1\%
x <- sim(spread = 0.01)

# estimate the spread
spread(x)

# by default this is equivalent to
edge(x$Open, x$High, x$Low, x$Close)

# estimate the spread using a rolling window of 21 periods
spread(x, width = 21)

# estimate the spread for each month
ep <- xts::endpoints(x, on = "months")
spread(x, width = ep)

# use multiple estimators
spread(x, method = c("EDGE", "AR", "CS", "ROLL", "OHLC", "OHL.CHL"))
