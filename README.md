# Efficient Estimation of Bid-Ask Spreads from Open, High, Low, and Close Prices

This repository implements an efficient estimation procedure of the bid-ask spread from Open, High, Low, and Close prices as proposed in Ardia, Guidotti, Kroencke (2021): https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3892335

Available in:

- [R](https://github.com/eguidotti/bidask/tree/main/R)
- [Python](https://github.com/eguidotti/bidask/tree/main/python)

You can also check the [pseudocode](https://github.com/eguidotti/bidask/tree/main/pseudocode) to implement the estimator in any programming language.
