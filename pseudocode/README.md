# Pseudocode

This file provides the pseudocode to simplify implementations of the estimator in any programming language. 

### Input

Vectors of `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` prices. The vectors must be sorted in ascending order of the timestamp. The function should also accept the argument `sign` specifying whether to return signed estimates.

### Output

Numeric spread estimate. A value of 0.01 corresponds to a spread of 1%.

### Algorithm

```python
# check that the open, high, low, and close prices have the same length
nobs = len(open)
if len(high) != nobs or len(low) != nobs or len(close) != nobs:
	raise error

# return missing if there are less than 3 observations
if nobs < 3:
	return missing

# compute log-prices
o = log(open)
h = log(high)
l = log(low)
c = log(close)
m = (h + l) / 2.

# shift log-prices by one period
h1 = lag(h)
l1 = lag(l)
c1 = lag(c)
m1 = lag(m)

# compute log-returns
r1 = m - o
r2 = o - m1
r3 = m - c1
r4 = c1 - m1
r5 = o - c1

# compute indicator variables
# (note: comparisons involving missing values must be missing)
tau = h != l or l != c1 
po1 = tau and o != h
po2 = tau and o != l
pc1 = tau and c1 != h1
pc2 = tau and c1 != l1

# return missing if there are less than two periods with tau=1
if sum(tau) < 2:
  return missing

# compute probabilities
# (note: 0/0 must be missing; otherwise return missing if po or pc is zero)
pt = mean(tau)
po = mean(po1) + mean(po2)
pc = mean(pc1) + mean(pc2)

# compute de-meaned log-returns
d1 = r1 - mean(r1)/pt*tau
d3 = r3 - mean(r3)/pt*tau
d5 = r5 - mean(r5)/pt*tau

# compute input vectors
x1 = -4./po*d1*r2 + -4./pc*d3*r4 
x2 = -4./po*d1*r5 + -4./pc*d5*r4 

# compute expectations
e1 = mean(x1)
e2 = mean(x2)

# compute variances
v1 = mean(x1*x1) - e1*e1
v2 = mean(x2*x2) - e2*e2

# compute square spread by using a (equally) weighted 
# average if the total variance is (not) positive
vt = v1 + v2
if vt > 0:
  s2 = (v2*e1 + v1*e2) / vt
else:
  s2 = (e1 + e2) / 2.

# compute signed root
s = sqrt(abs(s2))
if sign and s2 < 0: 
    s = -s

# return the spread
return s
```

### Testing

To test your implementation, import the data available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eguidotti/bidask/main/pseudocode/ohlc.csv). The file contains sample OHLC simulated price data to simplify testing. The data have been generated by simulating a price process as described in [Ardia, Guidotti, & Kroencke (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2024.103916) with 390 trades per day and a 1% probability to observe a trade. The simulation uses a constant spread of 1%. By running the estimation, you should obtain a spread estimate of **0.0101849034905478**. If you obtain a different results, you may use the following table to check and debug the intermediate steps.

| variable | value        |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `pt`     | 0.9820982    |
| `po`     | 1.227923     |
| `pc`     | 1.205221     |
| `e1`     | 0.0001070243 |
| `e2`     | 0.0001015958 |
| `v1`     | 2.074216e-06 |
| `v2`     | 1.346128e-06 |
| `s2`     | 0.0001037323 |
